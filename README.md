##  Technology Stack

Below are the core technologies used in building the Airbnb Clone Project, along with their purposes:

###  Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides built-in tools for authentication, ORM, and admin interfaces, making it ideal for developing secure and scalable RESTful APIs.

###  MySQL
A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage structured data such as user profiles, bookings, listings, and reviews. It supports complex queries and relationships.

###  GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It offers more flexibility compared to REST and helps reduce over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

###  Docker
A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

###  Git & GitHub
Version control tools used for source code management and collaboration. GitHub also enables project tracking, pull requests, and CI/CD pipeline integration.

###  GitHub Actions
A CI/CD platform that automates testing and deployment workflows. Used to trigger actions like running tests or deploying the app whenever code is pushed to the repository.

###  Markdown
A lightweight markup language used to write project documentation files like `README.md`. It helps present information clearly and professionally on GitHub.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a relational database to store and manage data. Below are the main entities (tables), their key fields, and how they relate to one another.

###  1. Users
Represents people who use the platform to either host or book properties.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `is_host` (Boolean to determine if the user is a host)

###  2. Properties
Represents properties listed by hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

###  3. Bookings
Represents reservations made by users for a property.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `total_price`

###  4. Reviews
Represents feedback given by users after staying at a property.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties)
- `rating` (1‚Äì5 stars)
- `comment`

###  5. Payments
Represents payment transactions for bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Bookings)
- `payment_method`
- `payment_status`
- `amount`

---

###  Entity Relationships

- **A user** can list multiple **properties** (`1-to-many`).
- **A property** can receive multiple **bookings** (`1-to-many`).
- **A user** can make multiple **bookings** (`1-to-many`).
- **Each booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property** (`many-to-1`).
- **A property** can have multiple **reviews** from different **users** (`1-to-many`).
- **Each booking** has one **payment** record (`1-to-1`).

This relational model ensures structured data storage and efficient querying for a scalable backend system.

##  Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that work together to simulate a real-world booking platform.

###  User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It supports user roles such as guests and hosts, enabling role-specific access to features like property listing or booking.

###  Property Management
Hosts can list properties with detailed information including title, description, location, price, and images. This feature allows full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on listings, giving hosts control over their rental offerings.

###  Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and make bookings based on their travel dates. The system calculates total pricing and ensures that properties are not double-booked.

###  Review & Rating System
After completing a stay, users can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust within the platform by helping future guests evaluate potential listings based on past experiences.

###  Payment Processing
Secure payment processing enables guests to pay for bookings using supported payment methods. This feature ensures a smooth and safe transaction flow between guests and hosts.

###  API Security
Authentication, authorization, and input validation are implemented to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like editing or deleting content.

###  CI/CD Integration
Automated workflows using GitHub Actions and Docker streamline the testing and deployment process. This ensures new features and updates are delivered quickly and reliably without disrupting the application.

##  API Security

Securing the backend APIs of the Airbnb Clone Project is critical to protecting sensitive user data, financial transactions, and overall application integrity. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:

###  Authentication
Authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected parts of the system. Using secure methods like token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), the system verifies the identity of users before granting access to personal data or restricted features.

 **Why it's important**: Protects user accounts, prevents unauthorized access, and secures personal information such as emails and payment history.

###  Authorization
Authorization controls what actions a user is allowed to perform after authentication. For instance, a guest should not be able to edit another host‚Äôs property listing.

 **Why it's important**: Prevents privilege escalation, protects business logic, and ensures users can only access or modify data they are permitted to.

###  Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts how many requests a user or IP can make to the API within a certain time frame. This is especially useful for preventing abuse and brute-force attacks.

 **Why it's important**: Helps protect against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and ensures API availability for all users.

###  Input Validation & Sanitization
Validating and sanitizing user input helps prevent common attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

 **Why it's important**: Ensures data integrity, protects the database, and defends against code injection attacks.

###  HTTPS & Data Encryption
All API communication will be conducted over HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted during transmission. Sensitive information such as login credentials and payment data must be securely encrypted at all times.

 **Why it's important**: Prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data theft during transmission.

By implementing these security measures, the Airbnb Clone Project ensures a safe and trustworthy experience for all users, hosts, and administrators.
